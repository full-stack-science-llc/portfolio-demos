## Recommended Sensor Configuration Updates

### High Priority Changes:

1. **Add Consistency Sensors** to Pulp Preparation and Headbox - most critical missing measurement
2. **Add pH Sensors** to Pulp Preparation and Headbox - essential for process control
3. **Specify Pressure Types** - vacuum pressure, steam pressure, nip pressure instead of generic pressure
4. **Add Quality Sensors** to Calendering - thickness, smoothness, gloss
5. **Add Roll Diameter Sensors** to Winding - critical for modern winding control

### Medium Priority Changes:

1. **Replace some Vibration sensors** with process-specific measurements
2. **Add Flow Rate sensors** where material balance is critical
3. **Add specialized moisture/dryness sensors** (infrared, microwave)

### Sensor Type Additions Needed:

- **CONSISTENCY** - % solids in pulp suspension
- **PH** - Acidity/alkalinity measurement
- **FLOW_RATE** - Volumetric or mass flow
- **VACUUM_PRESSURE** - Negative pressure for dewatering
- **STEAM_PRESSURE** - Pressure in steam systems
- **NIP_PRESSURE** - Pressure between rolls
- **LINEAR_LOAD** - Force per unit width
- **CALIPER** - Paper thickness
- **SMOOTHNESS** - Surface texture measurement
- **GLOSS** - Surface reflectance
- **ROLL_DIAMETER** - Winding roll size
- **INFRARED_TEMP** - Non-contact temperature
- **CONDUCTIVITY** - Electrical conductivity of liquids

This configuration would provide a much more realistic representation of actual paper mill instrumentation and the critical process variables that operators monitor in real facilities.
