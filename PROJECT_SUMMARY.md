# Project Summary: Voith Paper Mill Demo

This document outlines the vision, goals, and implementation details of the Voith Paper Mill real-time monitoring demonstration application.

## 1. Project Vision & Goals

The primary goal of this project is to create a visually compelling, browser-native application that simulates a real-time monitoring system for an industrial paper mill. The demo is intended to showcase how a modern sensor suite can be used to detect and diagnose common, costly issues like paper breaks.

### Key Objectives:

*   **Visual Representation:** Create a clean, professional, and intuitive visual diagram of a paper mill, including all typical components and sensor groups.
*   **Real-Time Simulation:** Simulate a continuous stream of sensor data (e.g., temperature, pressure, vibration) that reflects normal operating conditions.
*   **Issue Introduction:** Allow users to introduce common paper mill issues (e.g., "Paper Break," "Bearing Failure") and see how these issues manifest as anomalies in the sensor signals.
*   **High-Level Dashboard:** The primary user interface should be a high-level dashboard, similar to what a plant supervisor would use, providing an at-a-glance overview of the mill's health.
*   **Drill-Down Capability:** Enable users to click on specific components of the mill to "drill down" and view detailed sensor data for that area.
*   **Aesthetic Alignment:** The application's design, typography, and color palette must align with the professional and modern aesthetic of the Voith corporate brand.

## 2. Work Completed

To achieve the project vision, the following key tasks have been completed, transforming the initial concept into a functional and polished application.

### Phase 1: Foundational Scaffolding & UI/UX Overhaul

*   **Technology Stack:** Established a modern, browser-native technology stack using **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Chart.js**.
*   **Aesthetic & Branding:**
    *   Analyzed the Voith style guide to create a custom theme in Tailwind CSS, incorporating the official color palette (`voith-blue`, `voith-gray`, etc.).
    *   Integrated the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts to align with the clean, modern typography of the Voith brand.
*   **Layout & Navigation:**
    *   Replaced the basic header with a full-featured, responsive **Navbar** component that mirrors the design of the Voith website, including the logo, primary navigation, and utility links.
    *   Restructured the main application layout to be a clean, single-column dashboard view, improving spacing and overall UX.

### Phase 2: Core Logic & Data Model Refactoring

*   **Granular Data Simulation:**
    *   Overhauled the core data model (`millData.js`) to support **unique sensor instances** for each component (e.g., `PRESS_SECTION_TEMPERATURE` is now distinct from `DRYING_SECTION_TEMPERATURE`).
    *   Rewrote the `useSensorData` simulation hook to manage the state for each of these unique sensors independently, providing a much more accurate and realistic simulation.
*   **Status Calculation:** The simulation hook now calculates the status (`normal`, `warning`, `critical`) for each individual sensor based on its value relative to its defined ranges.

### Phase 3: High-Level Dashboard & Drill-Down Functionality

*   **Intuitive Status Indicators:**
    *   Removed the previous system of colored dots for every component.
    *   Implemented a more focused **hazard icon** (`!`) that appears next to a component *only* when one of its sensors enters a "warning" or "critical" state. This makes the UI cleaner and draws immediate attention to problems.
*   **Interactive Drill-Down:**
    *   Made each component in the paper mill diagram clickable.
    *   Implemented a "drill-down" view. When a user clicks a component, a detailed **Sensor Dashboard** appears, showing *only* the sensor charts relevant to that specific component.
    *   The main dashboard view is now clean and high-level, with the detailed charts hidden by default until a user chooses to investigate.

### Phase 4: Control Panel Redesign

*   **Improved UX:** Replaced the original dropdown menu with cleaner, more professional buttons for "Introduce Random Issue" and "Reset Simulation," improving the overall look and feel of the control panel.

The result of this work is a sophisticated and interactive web application that successfully meets the project's goals, providing a powerful tool for demonstrating the value of real-time monitoring in an industrial setting.
